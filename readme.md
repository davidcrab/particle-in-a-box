# Particle in a box
The figures show me how the energy levels and wavefunctions change as the particle does from the ground state (lowest energy) to the higher energy states

I observed that the energy levels are quantized, and the wavefunctions have more nodes as the i go to higher energy states 

##### This does not take into account things like the spin of the particle or the time-dependence of the wave function. it assumes that the potential is zero everywhere inside the box and infinite ourside (a sunplification of the real world)

This is intended as a good starting point for understanding the basics of quantum mechanics

The wavefunction gives us the probabilities of finding the particle in each of these states (remember a particle can exist in multiple states simultaneously -- superposition even though we our observes or measurements will only find the particle in one state) 

### Notes to self
this experiment/simulation has led to some interesting explorations into Copenhagen interpretation, many-worlds interpretation and pilot wave. Additionally, how quantum mechanics is at play all around us (LEDs, Transistors, Lasers)

It has helped me visualize and understand strange quantum behaviors at a basic enough level that I am curious and eager to learn more. 

#### Figure 5 - Probability Densities 
- tells me how likely i am to find the particle at that position if you i were to make a measure (which would then collapse the wavefunction!!! so cool)
### Obersations 
probability density is never zero inside the box (exception: at nodes) and always zero outside the box
particle is trapped inside the box and cannot escape 
probability density becomes more spread out as I go to higher energy levels -- reflects great uncertainty in the particle's position
