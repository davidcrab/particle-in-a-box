# Particle in a box
The figures show me how the energy levels and wavefunctions change as the particle does from the ground state (lowest energy) to the higher energy states

I observed that the energy levels are quantized, and the wavefunctions have more nodes as the i go to higher energy states 

##### This does not take into account things like the spin of the particle or the time-dependence of the wave function. it assumes that the potential is zero everywhere inside the box and infinite ourside (a sunplification of the real world)

This is intended as a good starting point for understanding the basics of quantum mechanics

The wavefunction gives us the probabilities of finding the particle in each of these states (remember a particle can exist in multiple states simultaneously -- superposition even though we our observes or measurements will only find the particle in one state)
